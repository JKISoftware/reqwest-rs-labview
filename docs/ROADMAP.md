## Project Status

**This library has matured significantly and is now feature-complete for most HTTP client use cases.** The core functionality described in the original roadmap has been implemented and is being used successfully in production JKI projects.

## Guiding Principles

*   **Production Ready:** This library has evolved from experimental to production-ready. The core API is stable, though minor enhancements may still be added.
*   **Async-Only Core:** The Rust library **only** exposes non-blocking, asynchronous functions. Synchronous (blocking) wrappers are built in the LabVIEW layer when needed.
*   **Comprehensive LabVIEW Integration:** Full LabVIEW wrapper library with 70+ VIs providing a native LabVIEW experience.

## Implemented Features

The following features have been successfully implemented and are available in the current version:

### ✅ **Client-Wide Configuration - COMPLETED**

- **✅ Timeouts:** Connection timeouts and request timeouts are fully supported
- **✅ SSL Verification Control:** Can disable SSL certificate verification with `client_builder_danger_accept_invalid_certs`
- **✅ Default Headers:** Client builder supports setting default headers for all requests
- **✅ Proxy Configuration:** Comprehensive proxy support including HTTP and SOCKS proxies
- **✅ Redirect Policy:** Configurable redirect handling

### ✅ **Rich Request Customization - COMPLETED**

- **✅ Flexible Headers:** Full header map support for any HTTP method with `headers_create/add/destroy`
- **✅ Multiple Body Types:** Support for JSON, form data, and raw binary data
- **✅ Authentication:** Built-in Basic and Bearer token authentication methods
- **✅ Query Parameters:** Structured query parameter building with `request_builder_query`
- **✅ All HTTP Methods:** GET, POST, PUT, DELETE with full customization

### ✅ **Detailed Response Information - COMPLETED**

- **✅ Response Headers:** Full access to response headers with `request_read_response_headers`
- **✅ Status Codes:** Direct status code access with `request_read_response_status`
- **✅ Response Bodies:** Complete response body handling with `request_read_response_body`
- **✅ Error Handling:** Comprehensive error reporting with `request_read_transport_error`

### ✅ **Full Asynchronous Support - COMPLETED**

- **✅ Async All Methods:** Non-blocking versions of all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **✅ Progress Tracking:** Real-time progress information for requests
- **✅ Request Cancellation:** Ability to cancel in-flight requests
- **✅ File Downloads:** Direct-to-file streaming downloads

## Remaining Potential Enhancements

While the core functionality is complete, these features could be added in future versions:

### 1. **Multipart Form Support** (Not Yet Implemented)

The main feature not yet implemented from the original roadmap:

*   **Multipart Forms:** Support for `multipart/form-data` requests for file uploads is not currently available

### 2. **Additional Convenience Features** (Future Enhancements)

*   **Enhanced File Upload API:** While binary data uploads work, a more specialized file upload API could be added
*   **WebSocket Support:** Could add WebSocket client capabilities
*   **HTTP/3 Support:** Future reqwest versions may add HTTP/3, which could be exposed
*   **Advanced Compression:** Additional compression algorithms beyond the current support
*   **Request Retry Logic:** Built-in retry mechanisms with backoff strategies

## Implementation History

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundational Stability & Flexibility - **COMPLETED**

*   **Implementation:**
    - ✅ Complete Client Builder API (`client_builder_*` functions)
    - ✅ Reusable Header Map (`headers_*` functions)  
    - ✅ All synchronous functions removed - library is async-only
    - ✅ Comprehensive test coverage

### ✅ Phase 2: Rich Response Objects - **COMPLETED**
*   **Goal:** ✅ Provide users with access to response data like status codes and headers
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED** - Full response object access implemented
*   **Implementation:**
    - ✅ Complete Response access via `request_*` functions
    - ✅ Status code access (`request_read_response_status`)
    - ✅ Header access (`request_read_response_headers`)
    - ✅ Body access (`request_read_response_body`)
    - ✅ Error handling (`request_read_transport_error`)

### ✅ Phase 3: Expand Asynchronous Operations - **COMPLETED**
*   **Goal:** ✅ Provide full suite of asynchronous HTTP methods
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED** - All HTTP methods available with full customization
*   **Implementation:**
    - ✅ Async POST, PUT, DELETE via unified request builder pattern
    - ✅ JSON body support (`request_builder_json`)
    - ✅ Form data support (`request_builder_form`)  
    - ✅ Raw binary data support (`request_builder_body`)
    - ✅ File output support (`request_builder_set_output_file`)

### ✅ Phase 4: Advanced Features & Ergonomics - **MOSTLY COMPLETED**
*   **Goal:** ✅ Support for complex use cases and quality-of-life improvements  
*   **Status:** **MOSTLY COMPLETED** - Most advanced features implemented
*   **Implementation:**
    - ✅ Authentication Helpers (`request_builder_basic_auth`, `request_builder_bearer_auth`)
    - ❌ **Multipart Forms:** Not yet implemented - this is the main remaining feature
    - ✅ Query Parameter Builder (`request_builder_query`)
    - ✅ Proxy & Redirect Configuration (extensive proxy support in client builder)

## Current Development Status

**The library is production-ready and feature-complete for most HTTP client use cases.** It includes:

- **1200+ lines of FFI implementation** providing comprehensive HTTP client functionality
- **70+ LabVIEW VIs** offering a native LabVIEW programming experience  
- **Comprehensive test suite** (some tests currently fail due to network connectivity to httpbin.org, not missing functionality)
- **Cross-platform support** with pre-built binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Production use** in multiple JKI projects

## Next Steps

1. **Multipart Forms:** The primary remaining feature to implement for full HTTP client coverage
2. **Test Infrastructure:** Consider using a local test server instead of external httpbin.org dependency
3. **Documentation:** Continue improving developer and user documentation
4. **VI Package Release:** Create official VI Package for easier distribution
